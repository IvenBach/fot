# Herbalism

## Overview

Herbalism is performed with the 'Herbalism' or 'Herbal Lore' spell active. These spells are learned by Priest and Monks. Herbalism involves mixing items in your inventory with herbs in the world, which is done by stepping on to the herbs. The result will be some sort of potion added to your inventory.

In some locations, such as West Woodlands, the locations of herbs will change over time.

## Recipes

You do not need to explicitly learn these recipes from an NPC. You only need to have the correct items in your inventory while stepping on the correct herb with a herbalism spell active.
