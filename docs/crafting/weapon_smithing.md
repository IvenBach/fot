Weapons can be smithed using forges to improve their quality at the Tagor Forge in Tagor (76, 70). Only Rogues are able to use the Light Blade (left) and Soori (middle) forges, whereas only Warriors are able to use the Sword forge (right).

It costs 100 Gold and 1 day of labour to attempt to improve the quality of a weapon. It is very possible to break weapons, especially when your smithing skill is low. When you improve a weapon to its "Great" quality, you will gain a corresponding legend mark, indicating how many of that type of weapon you have smithed. These legend marks will improve your ability to smith the corresponding weapon. The order of weapon qualities is as follows:

Normal -> Good -> Fine -> Grand -> Great
