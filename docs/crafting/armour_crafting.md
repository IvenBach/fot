# Armour Crafting

Although most low-level armour is bought from merchants throughout Temuair, high level armour (41-97) must be crafted in a variety of ways.

## Level 41 Armour

The Goblin Blacksmith of Aibreann Forest (East Woodlands path leading into 6-1) will craft level 41 Aisling armour of your class in exchange for a Goblin Armour Piece. The Goblin Blacksmith can be found by entering East Woodlands 6-1, following the path until the intersection, and then heading right (east) until you enter East Woodlands 10-1. From there, continue east until you reach the Blacksmith's house (41, 26).

Speak with the Goblin Blacksmith in order to exchange a Goblin Armour Piece for your armour. Goblin Armour Pieces can be found randomly by slaying goblins through Temuair (West Woodlands, East Woodlands, etc.). The Goblin Armour Piece does not drop from the slain goblin to the ground, but rather will appear directly in your inventory after slaying the goblin.

You can exchange Goblin Armour Pieces for level 41 armour as many times as you would like.

## Level 71 Armour

The Grounds Keeper of Dubhaim Castle Grounds will craft level 71 armour of your class, after defeating a Dubhaim Cleric, in exchange for Dubhaim Cloth. The Grounds Keeper is located on the north side of the Dubhaim Castle Grounds (13, 9) and will only speak to Aislings if they can trust you're not dangerous. In order to convince the Grounds Keeper you're not dangerous, say "Greetings" out loud. The Keeper will give you a quest to venture into Dubhaim and defeat a Dubhaim Cleric.

The altar for summoning Dubhaim Clerics can be found in Dubhaim Castle North (entrance 34, 10). Proceed to Dubhaim Castle North 4-3, turn west, and enter Dubhaim Castle North 5-1. You will need to place Dubhaim skulls (Ghast Fiend, Gargoyle, etc.) into the altar in order to summon a creature. Often, further ghasts and gargoyles will be summoned, but sometimes a Dubhaim Cleric will be summoned. Defeat the Dubhaim Cleric and obtain Dubhaim Cloth.

Return to the Grounds Keeper with your Dubhaim Cloth and they will craft your level 71 armour. You can continue to exchange Dubhaim Cloth for more level 71 armour.
