Dubhaim Crypt is a repeatable, Rogue-only, solo instance accessible by speaking with Ventril at Dubhaim Castle (34, 21). Ventril will take you inside Dubhaim Crypt and you will have to defeat a wave of 20 Dunans, followed by collecting 10 Dubhaim Ore Fragments off the ground, before finally defeating the Dubhaim Horror boss and exiting the instance. The instance rewards good experience and resets every 4 hours, so you may wish to complete the instance frequently for experience.

Dubhaim Ore Fragments may be converted into Dubhaim Ore by speaking with Ventril and these ores can be exchanged with Ventril for items.

## Rewards

| **Item** | **Number of Ore** |
| - | - |
| Sacrificial Dagger | 500 |
