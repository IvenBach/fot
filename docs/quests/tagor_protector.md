# Tagor Protector

Things have been quite odd lately in Tagor, as undead creatures roam the outskirts of the city. Udom, the Tagor Citizen, of Tagor (40, 70) is getting a bit too old to fight the undead himself, and would like your help protecting Tagor.

Speak with Udom and agree to help him. Then head to the Old Macabre Pass off the path in Tagor (0, 35) and slay one zombie. This is a dangerous area for low-level characters and you should bring help if you attempt this at level 8. You will need to get the last hit on the zombie in order to get credit for the quest.

Return to Udom and inform him you've slain a zombie. He will reward you with 10,000 XP. He will then ask you to find his keys, which he lost on the north side of Tagor while sleeping behind the Ranger Station. Head to Nigel's House (29, 12) and exit through the back door (8, 0). Search around (59, 5) for Udom's keys and return to him with them. He will reward you with 20,000 XP.

Udom will ask one more favour of you. He would like you to confirm the rumour of zombies coming up through the floor of an old house. You will need to return to the Old Macabre Pass and make your way to the edge of the map (0, 38). There you will find a Cthonic Map sticking out from beneath the rubble with evidence of the Cthonic Ruins. Return to Udom with the map and he will reward you with 50,000 XP and the "Tagor Historian" legend mark.
