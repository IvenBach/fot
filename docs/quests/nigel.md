# Nigel's Lost Necklace

If you have never found Nigel's necklace before, then while walking around Old Macabre Pass (accessible through Tagor near the bank and potion shop) you will discover a necklace on the ground. This necklace will have an inscription saying "Property of Nigel". Head to Nigel of Tagor, who can be found in Nigel's House (29, 12). Explain to Nigel that you've found his missing necklace and he will give you a spare necklace as a reward. He will even add your name to the necklace!

The necklace Nigel rewards you will be somewhat random. If the necklace is a Ciad Necklace (common), then it will give +1 to one of your stats (chosen randomly). If the necklace is a Tiota Necklace (uncommon), then it will give +2 to one of your stats (chosen randomly).

You can return your necklace back to Nigel to repeat this quest. However, other than the very first repeat, you must wait two weeks between repeating the quest. You may receive a different necklace when you repeat the quest.
