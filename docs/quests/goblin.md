The Goblin Foreman can be found in the Goblin Hideouot, which is found by travelling west at Pravat Cave (11, 19). In order to speak with the Goblin Foreman, you will need to ally yourself with Goblins. This can be done by speaking with Ethan at Pravat Cave entrance (27, 14).

## Fight Grimlocks

You will need to slay any 10 Grimlocks in Pravat Cave and return to the Goblin Foreman for your reward. The reward is 50,000 XP.

## Precious Gems

You will need to collect 1 Flawed Ruby, 1 Flawed Coral, and 1 Flawed Beryl. Return the gems to the Goblin Foreman for your reward. You will receive a variable amount of gold, equal to (Goblin Honour) * 100.

## Rare Weapons

You will need to obtain a rare Grimlock Dagger from one of the Pravat Grimlock. Slay Grimlocks until the Grimlock Dagger appears in your inventory. Return to the Goblin Foreman and receive experience for completing the quest. The amount of experience appears to be variable; perhaps related to level or Goblin honour.
