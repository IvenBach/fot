The Goblin Foreman can be found in the Goblin Hideouot, which is found by travelling west at Pravat Cave (11, 19). In order to speak with the Goblin Foreman, you will need to ally yourself with Goblins. This can be done by speaking with Ethan at Pravat Cave entrance (27, 14).

## Fight Grimlocks

You will need to slay any 10 Grimlocks in Pravat Cave and return to the Goblin Foreman for your reward. The reward is 50,000 XP.

## Precious Gems

You will need to collect 1 Flawed Ruby, 1 Flawed Coral, and 1 Flawed Beryl. Return the gems to the Goblin Foreman for your reward. You will receive a variable amount of gold, equal to (Goblin Honour) \* 100.

## Rare Weapons

You will need to obtain a rare Grimlock Dagger from one of the Pravat Grimlock. Slay Grimlocks until the Grimlock Dagger appears in your inventory. Return to the Goblin Foreman and receive experience for completing the quest. You will receive experience equal to (Goblin Honour) \* 100.

## The Talos Mine

The Goblin Foreman asks you to enter the Talos Mine and fend off the strongest of the Grimlock that threaten their mines. You will enter an solo instance area where you will have to defeat all the Grimlock in the mine. These Grimlock have the possibility of dropping Talos Fragments. However, do not expect to obtain many of them in one expidition into the mine (approximately 2-5 Talos Fragments). This quest appears to reward an amount of XP equal to LVL \* 4000.
