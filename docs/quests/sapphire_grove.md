Sapphire Grove is a repeatable, Monk-only, solo instance accessible by speaking with the Sapphire Druid at the Sapphire Stream. The Sapphire Druid will take you inside the Sapphire Grove and you will have to defeat a wave of 20 Sapphire Guardians, followed by collecting 10 Sapphire Crystal Fragments off the ground, before finally defeating the boss and exiting the instance. The instance rewards good, level-appropriate experience and resets every 4 hours, so you may wish to complete the instance frequently for experience.

Sapphire Crystal Fragments may be converted into Sapphire Crystals by speaking with the Sapphire Druid and these ores can be exchanged with the Sapphire Druid for items.
