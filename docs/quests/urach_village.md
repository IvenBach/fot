# Urach Village

Urach Village is a repeatable, Warrior-only, solo instance accessible by speaking with Guard Captain Alred at East Woodlands. The Guard Captain will take you inside Urach Village and you will have to defeat a wave of Urach Goblins, followed by collecting 10 Urach Ore Fragments off the ground, before finally defeating the boss and exiting the instance. The instance rewards good, level-appropriate experience and resets every 4 hours, so you may wish to complete the instance frequently for experience.

Urach Ore Fragments may be converted into Urach Ore by speaking with Guard Captain Alred and these ores can be exchanged with the Guard Captain for items.
