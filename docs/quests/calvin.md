# Calvin's Item Retrieval

Calvin can be found wandering (mostly) clockwise around Mileth. He will pass by Aldair, the Temple of Choosing, and the Mileth Crypt.

Calvin would like you to find a random item; usually some kind of armour. Find this item and return it to him to receive gold and experience. The reward appears to be variable, possibly depending on the item returned or the level completed.
