# Ansel Lost Bracelet

Ansel can be found in distress in the Rucesion Corridor (19, 0) (outside the Luathas Temple).

If you have never found Ansel's bracelet before, then while walking around many of the Dubhaim areas with enemies you will discover a bracelet on the ground. This bracelet will have an inscription saying "Property of Ansel". Return to Ansel and explain to him that you've found his missing bracelet and he will give you a shield as a reward. He will even add your name to the shield!

The shield that Ansel rewards you will be somewhat random. If the shield is a 'Lesser' shield (common), then it will give +3 to one of your stats. If the shield is a 'Greater' shield (uncommon), then it will give +4 to one of your stats.

You can return your shield back to Ansel to repeat this quest. However, other than the very first repeat, you must wait two weeks between repeating the quest. You may receive a different shield when you repeat the quest.
