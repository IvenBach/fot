## Noteworthy Areas

This is not an exhaustive list of all hunting areas, but rather some recommended hunting areas.

| **Name** | **Level Range** | **Notes** |
| - | - | - |
| Tagor Path | 8 - 20 | All enemies are undead. <br> Effective for solo Priests. |
| Astrid (South) | 11 - 25 | All enemies are passive. |
| Dubhaim Castle | 20 - 50 | Dunans drop Talos Fragments. <br> Effective for solo Priests. |

## XP Drain

Every additional group member drains a small amount of XP (~7%) that would be granted to the group. Additionally, the level difference between the highest level group member and lowest level group member should not be more than 20. A difference of 20 or greater will result in a severe experience penalty for group members.

## Group Composition

Although group compositions can be varied, it's generally important to have access to the spell "Fas Nadur" (or its variants) and healing. This generally means bringing a Wizard and Priest to every group. Monks, Warriors, and Rogues can be great damage dealers, with Monks and Warriors being able to take damage from enemies and rogues providing crowd control abilities.

## Sign Quests

There are signs that exist in hunting areas throughout Temuair. These signs will offer quests to slay 10 of a particular kind of enemy and reward you with a level-appropriate amount of XP for completing the quest. You can do these quests 4 (?) times per day, per location (i.e. Mileth Crypt, East Woodlands, etc.). However, it is possible that if you level into a different level bracket, you may be able to do quests again at a particular location after previously completing them all. It's worthwhile grabbing these sign quests regularly while hunting, if it doesn't take too long to travel back and forth.
