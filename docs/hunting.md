## Noteworthy Areas

This is not an exhaustive list of all hunting areas, but rather some recommended hunting areas, based on my personal experience.

| **Name** | **Approximate<br>Level Range** | **Notes** |
| - | - | - |
| Mileth Crypt (1-3) | 3 - 15 | Enemies on floors 1 and 2 have no elemental defense. |
| Tagor Path | 8 - 20 | All enemies are undead. <br> Effective for solo Priests. |
| Astrid (South) | 11 - 25 | All enemies are passive. |
| Dubhaim Castle | 20 - 50 | Dunans drop Talos Fragments. <br> Effective for solo Priests. |
| Lynith Sea | 31 - 55 | All enemies are passive in entrance. |
| House Macabre (Nikuru) | 41 - 50 | Nikuru are passive. |
| Undine Field (North) | 50 - 65 |  |
| Cthonic Remains (11-30) | 61 - 99 |  |
| Kasmanium Mines | 65 - 99 |  |
| Ice Caves | 70+ | Very useful place for leeching level 70+ characters. |
| Loures Canals | 90+ | Will need bashers. <br> All enemies in the first two rooms are water defense. |
| Oren Ruins | 99 | Very high experience with Wizards casting Gar spells. |

## Example Progression

The following are typically the areas I hunt when leveling a new character:

| **Name** | **Approximate<br>Level Range** |
| - | - |
| Mileth Crypt <br> East Woodlands <br> Astrid (Leech) | 1 - 20 |
| Dubhaim Castle | 20 - 50 |
| Undine Field (North) | 50 - 70 |
| Ice Caves (Leech) | 70+ |
| Oren Ruins <br> Chaos | 99+ |

## XP Drain

Every additional group member drains a small amount of XP (~5% of solo XP) that would be granted to the group. Additionally, the level difference between the highest level group member and lowest level group member should not be more than 20. A difference of 20 or greater will result in a severe experience penalty for group members.

## XP Loss

In order to receive full experience for a kill, your character will need to be within 15 levels of the slain monster.

## Group Composition

Although group compositions can be varied, it's generally important to have access to the spell "Fas Nadur" (or its variants) and healing. This generally means bringing a Wizard and Priest to every group. Monks, Warriors, and Rogues can be great damage dealers, with Monks and Warriors being able to take damage from enemies and rogues providing crowd control abilities.

While not necessary, it can be very helpful to have someone read the elements of the enemies' defense. Otherwise, you will have to guess the defensive elements, which will likely involve rotating through your elemental necklaces or elemental attacks until you find one that does the amount of damage you're expecting.

## Sign Quests

There are signs that exist in hunting areas throughout Temuair. These signs will offer quests to slay 10 of a particular kind of enemy and reward you with a level-appropriate amount of XP for completing the quest. You can do these quests 4 (?) times per day, per location (i.e. Mileth Crypt, East Woodlands, etc.). However, it is possible that if you level into a different level bracket, you may be able to do quests again at a particular location after previously completing them all. It's worthwhile grabbing these sign quests regularly while hunting, if it doesn't take too long to travel back and forth.

## Experience Needed

The following is a table of how much experience you need in order to level. This table is an estimation of the leveling formula, and appears to be inaccurate by no more than 5 XP at any level.
