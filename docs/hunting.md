## XP Drain

Every additional group member drains a small amount of XP (~7%) that would be granted to the group. Additionally, the level difference between the highest level group member and lowest level group member should not be more than 20. A difference of 20 or greater will result in a severe experience penalty for group members.

## Group Composition

Although group compositions can be varied, it's generally important to have access to the spell "Fas Nadur" (or its variants) and healing. This generally means bringing a Wizard and Priest to every group. Monks, Warriors, and Rogues can be great damage dealers, with Monks and Warriors being able to take damage from enemies and rogues providing crowd control abilities.
