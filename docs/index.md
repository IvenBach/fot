# Fragments of Temuair

This fan website is written by Eric in the hope that it will be accurate and useful. I am not associated with the [Fragments of Temuair](https://fragmentsoftemuair.com/) development team.

Fragments of Temuair is a Dark Ages-inspired game created by Slyk, built upon the Lorule client created by Wren. It is a free server and there is no content hidden behind a paywall. The game features new skills, spells, items, NPCs, quests, and maps. It also contains entirely new systems, such as fragments, endless dungeons, and transcended character progression.
