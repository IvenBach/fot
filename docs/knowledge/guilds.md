# Guilds

Guilds are a way for likeminded players to join together. It may be challenging for new players to afford to create a guild, but being in a guild has a few benefits.

## Creation

Guilds can be created by speaking to the Guild Manager in any of Temuairs four castles (located in Mileth, Loures, Rucesion, and Suomi). It costs 10M Gold to create a guild. Guilds initially have room for 5 members, but additional member slots can be added by offering [upgraded items](../../crafting/upgrades).

## Roles

Guilds have the following roles:

- Guild Leader (1)
- Captain (1)
- Officer (3)
- Member

## Benefits

Guilds can compete in PvP battles for control over Temuairs four castles. Holding these castles for longer and longer will reward greater and greater benefits to the controlling guild.

Guild members can also communicate with each other using guild chat ("!").
