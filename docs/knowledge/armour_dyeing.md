You can dye many armours by speaking to an armour dyer. When you dye armour, the colour changes and the dyed armour will give you more health. However, there is a chance that the armour will be destroyed when attempting to dye it. You must be of the same class as the type of armour you are trying to dye (ex: a Wizard to dye Wizard armour).
