## Mechanics

You get 12 "Temuair" days of labour every real-world day. Unused labour is not carried over and is replenished every 24 hours, based on the time your character was created.

## Temuair Labour Authority

At the Temuair Labour Authority, which is located in the [Temuair Marketplace](../marketplace) (within Loures), you can obtain Transfer Papers and Working Papers.
