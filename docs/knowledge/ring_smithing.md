Ring Smithing is performed by Rogues in the Abel Armor Shop. Speak with the Abel Armor Dealer and select "Smith Rings" to see a list of rings you can smith. Each attempt at Ring Smithing requires one day of labour and resources. It is possible to fail to smith a ring, in which case the labour and materials are lost.
