## Obtaining a Backpack

Each Aisling can obtain one backpack for free from any Tailor in Temuair. Simply speak to a Tailor and ask about "Backpacks".

## Usage

The backpack functions as a small bank that is carried by the player. The player can put items into the backpack and withdraw them later. The items in the backpack do not contribute their weight to the player carrying the backpack. Additionally, if you perish, any items in your backpack will be protected from being destroyed.

## Upgrading the Backpack

Your backpack starts with three pockets, allowing you to place three different types of items in the backpack. However, you can store multiple copies of the same item in the backpack, such as smoke bombs or red potions. If you would like to upgrade the backpack, you need to gather resources and speak to any Tailor in Temuair. Each time you upgrade the backpack, an additional pocket will be added to the backpack.
