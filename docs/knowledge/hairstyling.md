# Hairstyling

You can change your character's hair in two ways.

The first way is to visit the Abel Hair Parlor in Abel (12, 16). Speak with Hair Maiden and purchase either Hair Styling for 1,000 Gold (some hairstyles, no colouring) or Premium Hair Styling for 100,000 Gold (all hairstyles and colours).

The second way is to have a rogue with the Hairstyle skill style your character's hair. This is the equivalent of Premium Hair Styling (all hairstyles and colours). You (not the Rogue) will be able to select your hairstyle.
