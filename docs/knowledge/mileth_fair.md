## Pet Training

The Pet Training area is accessed from the Mileth Fairgrounds (0, 39). In the area, you can speak with Transmogrofer Talen to create a Transmog. A Transmog is a special type of creature that mimics the look of anything in Temuair. They can be used to battle another player's Transmog.

When choosing an appearance, the appearance seems to match the sprit list found [here](http://www.vorlof.com/general/spritelist.html) (external website).

You will gain an ability on your abilities pane called "Manage Transmog" that will let you summon your Transmog and fight others with it. You can dismiss your transmog by assailing it.
