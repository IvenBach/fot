Priests and Wizards are able to craft staves by speaking to the Woodland Priest in a house in East Woodlands 5-1 (92, 11). This requires 250,000 Gold, a strong stick (found by walking around EW 5-1), and some polished gems, depending on the staff you wish to create. You must be at least level 20 to craft a staff.
