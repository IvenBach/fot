# Insurance

You can purchase an insurance policy by visiting Loures Insurance in the [Temuair Marketplace](../marketplace) (15, 18) and speaking with the Loures Insurance Agent.

## Insurance Policy

An Insurance Policy will "ensure that on death, your current inventory and equipment remain safe from dropping or perishing". You will lose the Insurance Policy on death and need to purchase another. However, the cost of insurance will increase with each purchase.

The first purchase costs 2,500,000 Gold, and each additional purchase will cost an additional 2,500,000 more than the last.
