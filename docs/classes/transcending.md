# Transcending

Transcending your class is as simple as travelling to Medenia and speaking with an NPC. Transcension will grant you the ability to gain Ability levels, gain new weapons and armour, and purchase stats beyond your class's [maximum stats](../stats#maximum-stats).

## Prerequisites

In order to transcend your class, you will need to first become a [Grand Master](../grand_mastering) by defeating each of the four creants of Temuair. It is also highly recommended that you first [max your stats](../ascending), as the cost of buying stats will increase significantly after transcending.
