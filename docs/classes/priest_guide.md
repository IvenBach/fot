# Priest Guide

## Subbing

### Overview

The major consideration when [subbing](../subbing) is to learn all of the skills and spells and, ideally, have extra stat points left over for subbing. This is somewhat difficult because priests need a lot of stats to learn all of their pre-master spells. However, it is possible to sub with all spells and extra stats using various items, but your final stats may vary slightly depending on what items you have access to.

You can choose any [religion](../../knowledge/religion), but remember to incorporate those gained stats as part of your base stats. Choosing Ceannlaidir or Sgrios will make the stat plan more challenging, but still possible.

### Plan

| | **Str** | **Int** | **Wis** | **Con** | **Dex** |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| **Base** | **3** | **72** | **94** | **15** | **10** |
| | | | | | |
| "Typical" Items | 17 | 17 | 16 | 16 | 21 |
| [Sgrios Relic Buff](../../knowledge/religion#priest-relics) | 3 | | | | |
| [Book of Sages](../../knowledge/books) | | 3 | | | |
| 2x Fae Fragments | | 4 | | | |
| 2x Ghast Fragments | | | 4 | | |
| 2x Succubus Fragments | | | 6 | | |
| 2x Goblin Guard Fragments | | | | 2 | |
| 2x Mantis Fragments| | | | | 2 |
| | | | | | |
| **Target** | **23** | **96** | **120** | **33** | **33** |
| Spell | Suain | Mor Dion | Nuadhaich | Deireas Faileas | Dall |

**Extra Stats: 22**

You can use up to 8 of these stats (leaving yourself with 14) to replace any of the above requirements as necessary. Or, if you don't care about carrying over any stats when you subclass, you may use any remaining stats to meet the stat requirements.

The "typical" items include:

- +2 from [Cap of Danaan](../../quests/gauntlet)
- +2 [Tiota Necklace](../../quests/nigel)
- Corral Earrings or Gold Earrings
- +4 [Ansel Shield](../../quests/ansel)
- Hy-Brasyl Belt
- A full set of God items

#### Subsitutions

As it is possible to [upgrade items](../../crafting/upgrades) so that they give extra stats, it may be easier to create upgraded gear sets, or borrow existing sets from other players. For example, with a full set of +10 gear, you will likely not need any fragments.

If you choose to create upgraded gear for yourself, it is recommended that you start with chest armour and a Hy-Brasyl belt, as these items slots typically do not provide stats normally, and you'll immediately get a benefit when upgrading them to +5.

### Checklist

- All skills and spells known.
- Select a religion and get the [god's relic](../../knowledge/religion#priest-relics).
- Choose all your [class specializations](../specializations#priest).
- Lower weight and equip armour.
- Lock weapon and armour in options (F4).
- Purchase an [Insurance Policy](../../knowledge/insurance)!

## Recommendations

When leveling up and placing stats, you should always try to prioritize placing stats into Wisdom first as early as possible. In this way, you will have the largest benefit to your mana pool by the time you reach a high level.

You can fulfil your role as a priest knowing only healing spells and few other spells. Cradh spells are helpful, but they don't seem to have as large of an impact on the time to kill a monster as Fas does. Personally, I found learning Deo Saighead around level 41 to be very helpful, as it meant I could solo somewhat better. However, other priests will avoid this spell until much later, favouring putting more stats into Wisdom.
