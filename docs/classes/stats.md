# Stats

When leveling a character, choosing how you place your stats can have major consequences for how your character plays. Of course, there are many different strategies for allocating stats and this is not definitive, but the following will be an overview of character stats and some general advice.

## Overview

| **Stat** | **Effect** |
| - | - |
| **Strength** | Increases the damage of assails <br> Increases carrying capacity <br> Increases the damage of Srad spells <br> Important for Warriors |
| **Intelligence** | Increases the damage of spells <br> Important for Wizards and Priests |
| **Wisdom** | Increases mana regeneration <br> Increases mana gained per level <br> Increases the damage of Sal spells <br> Important for Wizards and Priests <br> Somewhat important for Monks and Rogues|
| **Constitution** | Increases health regeneration <br> Increases health gained per level <br> Increases the damage of Monk abilities <br> Increases the damage of Creag spells <br> Important for Warriors and Monks <br> Somewhat important for Rogues, Wizards, and Priests |
| **Dexterity** | Increases the damage of Rogue abilities <br> Increases the damage of some Warrior abilities <br> Increases the damage of Athar spells <br> Important for Rogues <br> Somewhat important for Warriors and Monks |

## General Advice

In general, it's important to invest most of your early stats into Constitution, Wisdom, or both (depending or your class). This is because the amount of health and mana you gain per level is dependent on your Constitution and Wisdom, respectively, and the earlier you invest in these stats the more levels there are to benefit from the investment. Depending on what sort of access to stat items you have, you may need to put a few points in other stats to function as your class, but you should try to put as many points in Consitution and Wisdom as early as possible (as makes sense for your class).

As a rough benchmark:

- **Rogues** will benefit greatly from raising their Constitution and Wisdom to 20 before investing much in dexterity.
- **Priests** should try to raise their Wisdom to 50, putting only the minimum they need into Intelligence, before raising other stats.
- **Warriors** and **Monks** should aim to raise their Constitution to 40 before investing much in other stats.
- **Wizards** should try to prioritize Wisdom for Sal spells, while ensuring they are able to learn Fas spells.

Additionally, whether or not you plan on [subbing](../subbing) can change how you want to place your stats. When subbing from Priest or Wizard, you will likely need to be very careful in your stat placement, and not raise any one stat too highly, whereas these concerns don't matter as much if you're going Pure. Notably, although Intelligence is an important stat for Wizards, if you're subbing from a Wizard to another class, you won't need very much Intelligence to obtain all your spells. However, a Wizard that is going Pure would benefit very much from having a high Intelligence.
