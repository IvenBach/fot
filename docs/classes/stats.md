# Stats

When leveling a character, choosing how you place your stats can have major consequences for how your character plays. Of course, there are many different strategies for allocating stats and this is not a definitive guide, but the following will be an overview of character stats and some general advice.

## Primary

| **Stat** | **Effect** |
| - | - |
| **Strength** | Increases the damage of assails (melee attacks) <br> Increases carrying capacity <br> Every 15 gives +1% Stun Resist |
| **Intelligence** | Increases the damage of spells |
| **Wisdom** | Increases mana regeneration <br> Increases mana gained per level |
| **Constitution** | Increases health regeneration <br> Increases health gained per level <br> Increases the damage of some Monk abilities <br> Every 15 gives +1% Blind Resist |
| **Dexterity** | Improves hit rate (?) <br> Increases the damage of some Rogue and Warrior abilities <br> Every 15 gives +1% Poison Resist |

### General Advice

In general, it's important to invest most of your early stats into Constitution, Wisdom, or both (depending or your class). This is because the amount of health and mana you gain per level is dependent on your Constitution and Wisdom, respectively, and the earlier you invest in these stats the more levels there are to benefit from the investment. Depending on what sort of access to stat items you have, you may need to put a few points in other stats to function as your class, but you should try to put as many points in Consitution and Wisdom as early as possible (as makes sense for your class).

Additionally, whether or not you plan on [subbing](../subbing) can change how you want to place your stats. When subbing from Priest or Wizard, you will likely need to be very careful in your stat placement, and not raise any one stat too highly, whereas these concerns don't matter as much if you're going Pure. Notably, although Intelligence is an important stat for Wizards, if you're subbing from a Wizard to another class, you won't need very much Intelligence to obtain all your spells. However, a Wizard that is going Pure would benefit very much from having a high Intelligence.

### Maximum Stats

Before transcending your character, the maximum stats you can obtain depends on your class.

| **Class** | **Strength** | **Intelligence** | **Wisdom** | **Constitution** | **Dexterity** |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| **Warrior** | 215 | 100 | 100 | 180 | 150 |
| **Wizard** | 100 | 215 | 180 | 150 | 100 |
| **Priest** | 100 | 180 | 215 | 150 | 100 |
| **Monk** | 180 | 150 | 100 | 215 | 100 |
| **Rogue** | 180 | 100 | 100 | 150 | 215 |
