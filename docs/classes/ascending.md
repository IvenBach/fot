# Ascending

Ascending is the process of exchanging experience for more character power: health, mana, and stats. After completing a necessary quest, you can ascend for health and mana by placing a succubus hair into the Mileth altar and speaking with either Deoch (health) or Gramail (mana). Furthermore, you can purchase stats in exchange for health or experience by speaking with Bedor in the Temple of Choosing in Mileth.

## Ascension Quest

In order to be able to ascend, you need to complete the quest to slay the Bone Dragon at the bottom of the Kasmanium Mines, given to you by Ludar in Camp A'Chaid. After slaying the Bone Dragon, be sure to speak with Ludar again to fully complete the quest.
