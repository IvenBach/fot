# Ascending

<img src="../../images/sprites/deoch.png"/> <img src="../../images/sprites/gramail.png"/>

Ascending is the process of exchanging experience for more character power: health, mana, and stats. After completing a necessary quest, you can ascend for health and mana by placing a succubus hair into the Mileth altar and speaking with either Deoch (health) or Gramail (mana). Furthermore, you can purchase stats in exchange for health or experience by speaking with Bedor in the Temple of Choosing in Mileth.

## Ascension Quest

In order to be able to ascend, you need to complete the quest to slay the Bone Dragon at the bottom of the Kasmanium Mines, given to you by Ludar in Camp A'Chaid. After slaying the Bone Dragon, be sure to speak with Ludar again to fully complete the quest.

## Pre-Max Stats

### Experience

Please see the [stats calculator](../../tools/stats_calculator) to calculate how much experience is required to max your stats.

When ascending for stats directly at the Temple of Choosing, the experience cost formula appears to be as follows. Credit goes to Pablito for discovering this formula.

Let STAT be the current base value of the stat you're going to raise.

**Before Transcending**

XP COST = STAT * (BASE HP) * 17

**After Transcending**

XP COST = STAT * (BASE HP) * 20

### Example

For example, if my base HP is 5000, haven't transcended, and I want to raise my strength from 100 to 101 then it will cost:

XP COST = 100 * (5000 * 17)

XP COST = 8,500,000

## Post-Max Stats

When increasing stats beyond the your class-specific [maximum for that stat](../stats), the cost to increase the stat is as follows:

Let STAT be the current base value of the stat you're going to raise.

XP COST = STAT * 500,000

### Example

For example, if I am a Warrior, and I want to raise my strength from 250 to 251:

XP COST = 250 * 500,000

XP COST = 125,000,000

## HP

Please see the [HP calculator](../../tools/hp_calculator) to calculate how much experience is required to increase your HP.

When ascending for health by speaking to Deoch, the experience cost formula appears to be as follows:

**50 HP**

XP COST = (BASE HP) * 500

**500 HP**

XP COST = (BASE HP) * 5000

It is most efficient to buy 500 HP at a time, as you pay the cost relative to the starting point, rather than the increased cost at every 50 HP increment.

## MP

Please see the [MP calculator](../../tools/mp_calculator) to calculate how much experience is required to increase your MP.

When ascending for mana by speaking to Gramail, the experience cost formula appears to be as follows:

**25 MP**

XP COST = (BASE MP) * 500

**250 HP**

XP COST = (BASE MP) * 5000

It is most efficient to buy 250 MP at a time, as you pay the cost relative to the starting point, rather than the increased cost at every 25 MP increment.

## Remarks

You should consider only purchasing stats with experience when your HP is at or near its minimum (4000). When done this way, you will spend less experience overall when [maxing your stats](../stats/#maximum-stats).

Once a particular stat is higher than 150, it may be more effecient in terms of experience to purchase stats one by one by ascending for 250 HP and turning that HP into one stat. However, this will require you to use a Succubus hair for every stat point placed using this method.
