# Mastering

Once you reach level 99, you will be able to become a Master of your class. After becoming a Master, you will be able to learn new abilities, increase your character stats, and eventually work towards becoming a Grand Master.

## Requirements

In order to become a Master, you will need to have 200M experience (reaching level 99 [requires approximately 315M](../../hunting/#experience-needed)) and the two items that comprise your "master set". The items you need depend on your class.

These master sets can be obtained from slaying monsters in the deepest parts of the Cthonic Remains. The sets drop on floors 51-56. However, it can be a dangerous place for the unprepared, so be sure to bring help with you!

You will need to bring these items to the Temple of Choosing in Mileth and speak with Bedor (the mysterious old man). He will provide you with more information about becoming a Master and, if you are worthy, will be able to grant you the Mantle of Master.
